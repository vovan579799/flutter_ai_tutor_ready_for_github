Testing on real devices (quick guide):
- Android: enable USB debugging, run `flutter run` or build an APK: `flutter build apk --debug` then install.
- iOS: for physical device, use Xcode to sign and run; for TestFlight you will need an Apple Developer account and follow App Store Connect flow.

If you need, I can also produce a debug-signed APK for Android ready to sideload, or help prepare an AdHoc/Development IPA to install on your iPhone for testing.
